Welcome to the Shpyrd project! We're excited that you want to get involved and contribute to our community. Below are several ways you can participate and make a positive impact on Shpyrd:

## Engage with the Community

Our community actively connects on Discord. Join our Discord server to interact with other contributors and users. Here, you can ask questions, share ideas, and discuss potential improvements or changes to Shpyrd. To maintain a friendly and inclusive environment, please abide by our code of conduct during all interactions.

Make sure to take some time to read the architecture overview of Shpyrd. Understanding the design and structure will help you contribute effectively and align your efforts with the project's objectives.

## Issue Hunting

One of the most valuable contributions you can make is finding and addressing existing issues. Check out our GitHub issue tracker to discover problems, bugs, or feature requests that require attention. Feel free to seek clarification or additional information on any issue that catches your interest.

If you decide to work on a particular issue, ensure you are assigned to it or indicate your intention to prevent duplicate efforts. Once you have a solution, submit a pull request to share your proposed changes with the community for review.

## Propose New Features

We love hearing fresh ideas for Shpyrd! If you have exciting proposals for new features that could enhance the project, we'd like to know. Start by creating a new GitHub issue that describes the feature in detail. Engage with the community on Discord to gather feedback and refine your concept.

Remember, collaboration with the community and project maintainers will help shape the proposal and ensure its successful implementation.

## Support through Donations

Maintaining and developing Shpyrd requires both time and resources. If you find Shpyrd valuable and wish to contribute beyond code, consider supporting us through donations. Donations help cover support community events, and encourage further development.

Your contribution, regardless of its size, will be highly appreciated and will go a long way in supporting the sustainability of Shpyrd.
